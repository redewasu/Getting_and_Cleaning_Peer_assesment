Repository for Getting and Cleaning Course Project

This readme file contains general information about the Peer Assesment project (run_analysis.R) to complete the Getting and Cleaning Data course provided by Coursera

General information is provided below, but a better description of the code is embedded within the code.

Requirements:

1. R programming language - this code was written using R-Studio, but running it in R should work just as well.
2. Access to the internet and access to the file below:
  a. https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip 
  b. Description of file above can be found at: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones 
3. Create a folder in your computer where the unzipped file is located which you will access for the execution of the code.

An output called data_averages.txt will be generated that contains the average for the columns selected by subject and activity type in the directory folder created with setwd, unless specified otherwise.
